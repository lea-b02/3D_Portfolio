# 3D Interactive Portfolio â€“ Built with React.js & AWS
This 3D portfolio is an immersive, interactive experience designed to showcase my skills, projects, and services in a visually engaging way. Built with React.js, it leverages modern 3D technologies like Three.js and react-three-fiber to create a smooth and responsive user interface within a real-time 3D environment.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
React.js â€“ for building a dynamic and component-based user interface.

Three.js / react-three-fiber â€“ for rendering high-performance 3D graphics in the browser.

AWS (Amazon Web Services):

S3 for static site hosting.

CloudFront for fast and secure content delivery.

Lambda / API Gateway for serverless backend features (e.g., contact form handling).

DynamoDB (optional) to store user feedback or analytics data.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:
Smooth navigation through a custom 3D environment (scene, gallery, avatar, etc.).

Dynamic project showcases with interactive animations.

Fully responsive design, optimized for desktop and mobile.

Fast loading thanks to optimized 3D assets and AWS cloud infrastructure.

ðŸ§  Goal:
To provide a unique and modern user experience while demonstrating my technical expertise in web development, interactive 3D design, and cloud integration.
